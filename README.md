# dotfiles-i3-endeavouros-j3u6-Cu5t0m-D3
my configuration for running i3 on endeavouros or arch linux. still configuring to clear some errors in X and other small issues.
lightweight and fast DE configured for mini-pc's as a desktop computer. You will have to change some directories around as they
will not be the same as mine. some include /home/<your usr name>/.config/i3/config i3/i3blocks.conf i3/scripts/* . Endeavour 
is or has mostly set up Arch Linux to be user freindly, as this build utilizes features built in from EOS. It is recommended to
be running eos if using this, unless you understand how arch linux operates. Have a great day!
